        <h2>Test Summarization</h2>
        <p>Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational technology, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena to process information in fundamentally new ways. Unlike classical computers that use binary bits, quantum computers employ quantum bits (qubits) capable of existing in superposition states, enabling parallel exploration of multiple possibilities simultaneously.</p>
        
        <p>This quantum advantage is most evident in specific domains such as cryptography, optimization, and the simulation of quantum systems. Current prototypes from companies like IBM, Google, and IonQ have demonstrated quantum advantage on narrow problem sets, though practical, large-scale applications remain limited by issues such as decoherence and error rates.</p>
        
        <p>The field is advancing rapidly, with researchers developing quantum error correction, new qubit technologies, and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that could transform industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to financial modeling within the next decade.</p>

    <div class="test-section">
        <h2>Test Simplification</h2>
        <p>The implementation of quantum computational paradigms necessitates the utilization of superposition and entanglement phenomena to achieve exponential algorithmic acceleration in specific problem domains, particularly those involving cryptographic protocols and optimization challenges that exhibit non-polynomial time complexity characteristics.</p>

    <article>
        <p>Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to information processing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems that are intractable for classical computers. Unlike traditional systems that use bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a phenomenon known as superposition.</p>
        
        <p>The power of quantum computing lies in its ability to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. Key areas of application include cryptography, where quantum algorithms could challenge existing encryption methods; molecular simulation for drug discovery; financial modeling and risk analysis; and large-scale optimization problems in logistics and supply chain management.</p>
        
        <p>Major technology companies and research institutions are investing heavily in this field. Although current quantum computers remain experimental and require extremely cold operating environments, researchers are making steady progress toward scalable, fault-tolerant systems. Advances in quantum error correction, novel qubit architectures, and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms hold promise for transforming industries from pharmaceuticals to artificial intelligence within the next decade.</p>
        
        <p>Another foundational concept, quantum entanglement, allows qubits to become correlated in ways that classical physics cannot explain. This property enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of information simultaneously, making them particularly suited for complex optimization, machine learning, and cryptographic analysis. Companies such as IBM, Google, Rigetti, and IonQ are leading efforts to achieve practical quantum advantage in real-world applications.</p>
